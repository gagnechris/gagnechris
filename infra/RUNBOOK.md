# AWS bootstrap runbook

One-time setup so this account is managed through IAM Identity Center and CDK, with no long-lived IAM access keys on a laptop.

**Operational constants** (account ID, org ID, Identity Center ARNs, portal URL, emails, hosted-zone IDs) live in a **private note**, not in this public repo. Look them up with the CLI when needed.

## Day-to-day access

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"   # arm64 CLI on Apple Silicon if needed
export AWS_PROFILE=gagnechris-readonly
aws sso login --sso-session gagnechris
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

Use profile `gagnechris-admin` only for bootstrap and break-glass.

## Rebuild outline (CLI only)

Concrete IDs and values: private note. Commands:

1. **Working AWS CLI** — prefer a current arm64 install (`~/.local/bin`) over an old x86_64 Homebrew binary.
2. **Organization** — management account with Organizations feature set `ALL`; enable trusted access for `sso.amazonaws.com`.
3. **Identity Center** — enable an **organization** instance in the console (us-east-1). Account instances cannot host permission sets. Record instance ARN and Identity Store ID via `aws sso-admin list-instances`.
4. **User + permission sets** — create the Identity Center user; create `ReadOnly` (default, e.g. 8h) and `Admin` (break-glass, e.g. 1h); attach `ReadOnlyAccess` / `AdministratorAccess`; assign both to the account.
5. **Local SSO profiles** — `sso-session` + profiles `gagnechris-readonly` / `gagnechris-admin` in `~/.aws/config` (start URL from Identity Store id). Login and verify both profiles before deleting any IAM access keys.
6. **Remove IAM user access keys** — only after SSO works. Clear stale keys from `~/.aws/credentials`. Keep a console break-glass login until SSO-only is comfortable.
7. **CDK bootstrap** — after SSO Admin works:  
   `npx aws-cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT/us-east-1 --profile gagnechris-admin`  
   (us-east-1 required for CloudFront certificates.)

## CDK app (`infra/`)

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=gagnechris-readonly   # or gagnechris-admin for deploy
aws sso login --sso-session gagnechris

# Synth / diff default to prod (account from credentials via CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT).
# Staging is typed and available later with `-c env=staging` — not deployed by default (cost).
# Alerts email is never committed — set ALERTS_EMAIL (or -c alertsEmail=...).
export ALERTS_EMAIL='you@example.com'   # use the address from your private note
npm run cdk -- synth
npm run cdk -- diff
npm run cdk -- deploy Guardrails-prod --profile gagnechris-admin
# npm run cdk -- synth -c env=staging   # when/if staging is needed
```

After deploying Guardrails:
1. Confirm the SNS subscription email (AWS sends a Confirm subscription link).
2. `aws budgets describe-budgets --account-id "$CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT" --profile gagnechris-readonly`
3. Optional test: publish to the alerts topic ARN from the stack outputs.

Optional override without relying on the CLI: `export CDK_ACCOUNT=...`

## Existing resources (CDK decisions)

| Resource | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Route 53 hosted zone for the site domain | **Look up** in CDK (`HostedZone.fromLookup`). Do not recreate. |
| Other Route 53 zones outside this project | **Leave alone.** |
| Existing ACM certs for the site domain | **Replace via CDK** when the certificate stack lands; keep until cutover. |
| Legacy IAM users | No access keys after bootstrap; disable/delete when SSO-only is enough. |
| `CDKToolkit` in us-east-1 | Created by bootstrap. |

## Agent notes

- Prefer SSO profiles once configured. Do not recreate an account-level Identity Center instance.
- Do not put account IDs, org IDs, portal URLs, emails, or access-key IDs in this public repo.
